## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js 15.5.6 (App Router)
- **UI Library:** shadcn/ui components
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **File Uploads:** React Dropzone

### Backend
- **API Routes:** Next.js API routes
- **AI Integration:** Google Generative AI SDK

## Security Measures

### Vulnerabilities Fixed
1. ✅ **Insecure Random Number Generation**
   - Problem: Using `Math.random()` for session IDs
   - Fix: Replaced with `crypto.randomUUID()`

2. ✅ **Prototype Pollution**
   - Problem: User-controlled session IDs could pollute Object.prototype
   - Fix: Session ID validation, `Object.create(null)`, safe property access

3. ✅ **File Upload Security**
   - File size limits enforced (10MB)
   - File type validation
   - Input sanitization

### Additional Security Features
- Environment variable protection for API keys
- `.gitignore` includes `.env.local`
- Session isolation
- Input validation on all API endpoints

## Code Quality

### Linting
- All ESLint errors fixed
- No React unescaped entities
- Consistent code formatting

### Testing
- Manual testing completed on all pages
- Dev server runs without errors
- All routes accessible and functional
- UI components render correctly

### CodeQL Security Analysis
- 0 security vulnerabilities remaining
- All high-severity issues resolved

## UI/UX Features

### Animations
- Framer Motion page transitions
- Component fade-ins and slide-ins
- Audio visualizer pulsing animations
- Chart loading animations
- Button hover effects

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Flexible grid systems
- Responsive charts
- Touch-friendly controls

### Accessibility
- shadcn/ui components (built on Radix UI)
- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators

### Visual Feedback
- Loading states for async operations
- Toast notifications for user actions
- Error states with helpful messages
- Success indicators
- Progress bars and score displays

## Known Limitations

1. **File Parsing:** Currently treats all files as plain text. Production should use proper PDF/DOCX parsers.
2. **Audio Transcription:** Simulated. Needs real STT service integration.
3. **Session Storage:** In-memory only. Will lose data on server restart.
4. **Gemini API Quota:** Free tier has limited requests. Monitor usage.
5. **Browser Compatibility:** Audio recording requires modern browsers with MediaRecorder API.

## Conclusion

All requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented:

✅ Upload page with multi-step indicator, file upload, validation, and toast notifications
✅ Interview interface with audio visualizer, recording controls, and real-time chat
✅ Feedback page with scores, charts, detailed analysis, and tabbed navigation
✅ Gemini API integration for question generation and feedback
